# Neural Network for fruits recognition

## Dataset

The dataset being used is the following: [Fruit Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karimabdulnabi/fruit-classification10-class)

This dataset contains training and testing sets with numerous images of the following types of fruits:

* Apple
* Orange
* Avocado
* Kiwi
* Mango
* Pineapple
* Strawberry
* Banana
* Cherry
* Watermelon


### Problem

The problem to be solved is the classification of ten types of fruits by processing them and training a neural network for this purpose.

## How to execute

First, see the [NeuralNetwork](./src/NeuralNetwork/README.md) guide file to know the requirements and usage of the neural network. Then you can execute normally any of the files in the src directory ("Evaluation.py", "Predict.py" or "Trainning.py") to use the neural network.

## Genetic algorithm

To execute the Genetic Algorithm, execute the "Optimize.py" file inside the "src" file.
